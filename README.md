## Using the SCPDiscord bot
1. Go to the startup tab in your server, then set `INSTALL SCP DISCORD?` to `true`.
2. Under the settings tab, press "Reinstall Server" and wait until the server has finished the process. **Re-installing will *not* delete your important files.**
3. Go to the files tab, and go to `/.egg/SCPDBot` and open `config.yml` to configure the bot.
> [!TIP]
> **To configure the bot and plugin, read the [installation guide](https://github.com/KarlOfDuty/SCPDiscord/blob/main/docs/Installation.md).**
